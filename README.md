## PasswordGenerator

# Project to utilise Javascript in creating a password generator

This is an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It features a clean and user interface which is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The requirements of the password generator is that it can create a random password with between 8 and 128 characters. It also is able to alter the inclusion of lowercase, uppercase, numeric and special characters via prompts to the user.

When the user has chosen all criteria a password is created and shown on the screen.
